Hi, Iâ€™m Julien. I am a research associate and PhD student at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. My research focuses on the sustainability of software from a technical perspective, in particular video games. To advance the research field of green gaming and reduce the power consumption of video games, I focus on four main areas: energy awareness, informedness, self-adaptability, and customizability. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work.
